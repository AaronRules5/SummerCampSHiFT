## Installing

### === NEW PAK METHOD ===
Video Tutorial: N/A

If you have already installed the mod using the old method in the past, choose one of these two options:

**OPTION A - Reinstalling Friday (Recommended):**
1. Uninstall through Steam
2. Delete the F13Game folder manually
3. Reinstall through Steam

**OPTION B - Disabling the Old Method:**
1. Make sure you have quickbms-friday downloaded
2. Drag EAC_Launcher.exe into Disable-Mods.bat
3. It should say that mod loading has been disabled (You will NOT need to re-enable it later)

Once you have completed either one of the two options, or you are already on a fresh install... you are ready to begin!

1. Download the newest release ZIP that has "Pak" in the name
2. Go to Friday the 13th in your Steam library
3. Click the âš™ and go to Manage > Browse local files
4. Copy everything that's in the ZIP folder to this directory
5. You're done! Try it out!

#### WARNING: CONFIRM THAT THE STORAGE DEVICE FRIDAY IS INSTALLED ON HAS AT LEAST 18 GIGABYTES OF FREE STORAGE BEFORE CONTINUING ####

1. Download quickbms-friday.zip and the Release zip from the most recent version at https://github.com/AaronRules5/SummerCampSHiFT/releases

   **HINT:** Open the "Assets" dropdown, and download both zip files that do not have "Source code" in the name.

2. Extract the contents of quickbms-friday.zip, and have the folder where you extracted it's contents to remain visible.

3. In Steam, Right click on "Friday the 13th: The Game" in the game list, and click on Manage > Browse local files.

4. Drag EAC_Launcher.exe from Friday's local files into the Extract-Friday-Assets.bat file that came with the zip you extracted.

5. Press any key to begin extraction. This process may take around 30 minutes to complete... Sorry.

6. Extract the contents of the Release zip, and copy the "SummerCamp" folder to the same folder where EAC_Launcher.exe resides.
   
   **HINT:** You'll know you did it right if it asks you to replace files. Replace the files in the destination.

7. You're DONE! Mod loading is enabled by default. If you would like to disable or re-enable mod loading, drag EAC_Launcher.exe into Disable-Mods.bat or Enable-Mods.bat
