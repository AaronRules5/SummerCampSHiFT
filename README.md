1. Download quickbms-friday from https://drive.google.com/file/d/118vFqdnsOpBNRmuWgu0V5aglY6FWniI8/view?usp=sharing

2. Extract the contents, and have the folder where you extracted it's contents to remain visible.

3. In Steam, Right click on "Friday the 13th: The Game" in the game list, and click on Manage > Browse local files.

4. Drag EAC_Launcher.exe from Friday's local files into the Extract-Friday-Assets.bat file that came with the zip you extracted.

5. Press any key to begin extraction. This process may take around 30 minutes to complete.

6. Once complete, download the most recent release zip at https://github.com/AaronRules5/SummerCampSHiFT/releases

   **HINT:** Open the "Assets" dropdown, and download the zip file that starts with "Release", not "Source code".

7. Extract the contents, and copy the "SummerCamp" folder to the same folder where EAC_Launcher.exe resides.
   
   **HINT:** You'll know you did it right if it asks you to replace files, choose Yes to All.

8. You're DONE! Mod loading is enabled by default. If you would like to disable or re-enable mod loading, drag EAC_Launcher.exe into Disable-Mods.bat or Enable-Mods.bat
