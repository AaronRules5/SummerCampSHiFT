"Cabins, hiding spots and interiors all offer benefits to the player, however it is much easier for Jason to spot your general location. Cabin doors can be barricaded to make it tougher for Jason to get inside, while windows can be opened to allow for a quick means of escape. Counselors can hide in and around various beds, dressers, tents and small areas to increase their chance of survival and perhaps even fool Jason."

"Corey Feldman was slated to reprise his role of Tommy Jarvis in Part V: A New Beginning. Unfortunately, being cast in two Spielberg movies lead to scheduling conflicts. A compromise was reached in which the child actor would appear, but only in the opening sequence. Director Danny Steinmann arranged for the crew to set up in Feldman's backyard. They put up extra bushes, had a rain machine, and wrapped the shoot in two hours. Ironically, even if Feldman had starred in the movie he wouldn’t have squared off with his nemesis because Jason doesn’t make an appearance in Part V!"

"Director John Buechler and Associate Producer Barbara Sachs sparred over many things during the production of Part VII, including the de-masking of Jason. “One of the things I lobbied for was to show Jason--mask off--for the better part of the last reel of the movie,” said Buechler. “She hated the look of Jason, she said ‘he looks like a frog. He’s so unbelievable.’ She vetoed the idea for me to do it at all.”"

"During filming of Part III, director Steve Miner called for a lighting check on Jason. None of the crew felt it worth it to apply the rigorous makeup so 3-D Supervisor Martin Jay Sadoff threw his Detroit Red Wings mask on Jason for the test. Thus an icon was born."

"During pre-production of Friday the 13th Part III, director Steve Miner called for a makeup test on Jason to get an idea of what he would look. Instead of applying the rigorous makeup to the actor just for the test, they tried out a Detroit Red Wings hockey mask from 3D effects supervisor Martin Jay Sadoff's bag of hockey gear. They liked what they saw, then created a new mask. Finally, they wrote a scene into the movie in which Shelly the prankster jumps out of Crystal Lake wearing a hockey mask to scare Chris. Though it’s never shown on camera, it was Shelly’s mask that Jason took and made his own."

"Each Challenge has a number of computer controlled counselors that are located around the map doing various actions. If Jason stays quiet, counselors will be unaware of his presence, and he can stalk and kill them discreetly. However, if a counselor sees or hears him, they will become terrified and either fight back or run away. It is Jason’s job to hunt down and kill all counselors that still draw breath."

"Fear is one of the largest issues a counselor will have to deal with while playing. Fear is a direct result of being pursued by Jason, being isolated and being in the dark. Discovering a dead body will also increase fear. The more fearful you are, the easier it is for Jason to sense you. To mitigate and reduce fear counselors should find lighted buildings, hide in various hiding spots, stick close to other counselors and reduce your noise as much as possible. The quicker you run and the faster you open doors, the more noise you create."

The theory was that the hockey mask had been on Jason for so long that the skin had grown around it. The difficulty was that Kane Hodder couldn’t take the mask off between takes. Hodder had to do the entire shoot and all the stunts by breathing his own exhaled air."

"In Part III Debbie and Andy, played by Tracie Savage and Jeffrey Rogers, canoodle in a hammock. After returning from a shower, Debbie lounges with a “Fangoria” magazine. She flips past an article about Tom Savini, the man behind many of the classic Friday special effects. Unluckily for her, Jason was hiding with a knife beneath the hammock."

"In Part III Shelly and Vera, two of the protagonists vacationing at Crystal Lake, get into a confrontation with a biker gang at a convenience store. In retaliation, the gang follows the two back to Crystal Lake with the intention of getting revenge. The bikers Ali, Fox, and Loco, siphon gas from a car in order to burn down the barn but are ultimately foiled when they encounter Jason. It is not revealed how Loco got his nickname. However, it seems appropriate given that the character is smoking a cigarette while siphoning gas."

"In Part VII, Tina and Nick escape the lakeside house before it explodes. Behind the scenes, multiple chargers were staged to create consecutive explosions. However, when the trigger was squeezed, the building was instantly enflamed and the blast broke the cameras. The longest salvageable piece of film was about 20 frames--less than a second."

"In one scene in Part VI, a group of campers are shown to be sleeping in a cabin. The camera pans over a little girl who has fallen asleep reading Jean-Paul Sartre’s novel “No Exit”. The novel is about three people spending eternity together in a small room and ends with the revelation: “Hell is other people.” Quite an odd book for a child to be reading. "

"In the famous end to Friday the 13th, Alice takes a canoe out on Crystal Lake. There she has a rather startling encounter with a young seaweed covered Jason Voorhees. If the special effects looked real, it’s because they were. According to Ari Lehman who played kid-Jason, Tom Savini dredged up part of the pond to cover him with real muck and mire."

"Jason also has access to two physical tools to increase his lethality; throwing knives and home-made bear traps. Throwing knives can be useful to inflict damage on a counselor at range, while the bear trap can be carefully hidden to stop counselors in their tracks. Skilled Jason players will use traps in frequently traveled areas while throwing knives can be used to hit counselors through windows and across obstacles. Throwing knives can be found around the map, just out of reach of counselors."

In Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, the director instructed seminal Jason actor Kane Hodder to kick a dog. Hodder, however, refused saying it wasn’t in the murderer’s character."

Andy’s death originally showed his stomach being sliced open and his leg cut off. Similarly, Edna, Vera, and Chili’s death scenes were shortened. Debbie’s hammock scene was also trimmed to spare the audience footage of her blood splattering."

"Of all the actors who have donned Jason’s hockey-mask, none have done so with more frequency than Kane Hodder. He appeared in Part VII, Part VIII, Part IX, and Part X, not to mention promotional guest appearances as Jason and in motion-capture studios for this very game. However in Part IX: Jason Goes to Hell, Hodder actually played three separate roles. Not only does he play the titular character, Hodder also plays a security guard who mocks Jason as well as the “gloved hand” that grabs the hockey mask in the final shot of the movie."

"One of the most emblematic moments of Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, was the scene of Jason in Times Square. Kane Hodder, who played Jason, stayed in character the whole time. There were hundreds of people on both sides of the street watching the filming. With one quick look from Jason the crowd would scream, cheer, and go wild."

"One particularly colorful character in Part V was foul mouthed Ethel Hubbard, played by Carol Locatell. In many ways Ethel was the foil to Pamela Voorhees. Both were cooks, both had special sons, and both had a great set of hair. In Ethel’s case it was a wig that Locatell had from a movie she was in with Burt Reynolds called Sharky's Machine."

"Part VI: Jason Lives film featured a re-casted Jason. After becoming disenchanted with the Jason that they had cast, filmmakers discovered a 6'3<q> 250lbs night-club owner named C. J. Graham. Graham was part of a hypnotist stage show whereby a magician would put audience members in a trance and ask them to imagine they were encountering Jason Voorhees. Graham would dress as Jason and scare them in the middle of the hypnosis. The production team was impressed and cast Graham as Jason for the movie."

"Part VII: The New Blood marks the first of four times Kane Hodder would play the role of Jason Voorhees--a series record. Hodder’s portrayal was met with wide acclaim, but it was not without cost. The veteran stuntman took a lot of abuse. He fell through a set of stairs, had an actual roof collapse on top of him and was set on fire for what was then, a Hollywood record."

"Playing as Jason gives you access to multiple abilities and tools. Jason is able to 'Morph,' around the map, 'Sense,' players through their fear and noise, 'Shift,' short distances to get a leg up on fleeing counselors, ‘Stalk,’ his victims by sneaking up on them and initiate a 'Rage,' mode that enhances his powers.  Jason will be able to 'Morph,' from the beginning as other abilities unlock over time. Each ability has a cooldown that rewards careful planning."

"Repairing vehicles, the phone box and electrical boxes is crucial to reducing fear and gaining means to escape. Each time you attempt to repair any item, a small mini-game will start. The higher your repair stat, the quicker you are at repairing. In the repair mini-game, you must hit the displayed button that is prompted when it appears. Success means quicker repair, failure will create noise that notifies Jason."

"The Spring Break 1984 Clothing Pack DLC introduced skimpy swimsuits and a new challenge for the art team at Illfonic. In an interview, Art Director Cole Gray stated: “We hadn’t built the system originally for the customization of swimsuits. We’ve had to overhaul how the characters function fundamentally. It has to do with a much larger scope of work that involves a gore system. So now we have to have a bunch of new clothes that work with the way our characters pop. Our characters are essentially crash-test dummies. They have to break apart at certain locations. It was a bit of a challenge.”  "

"The release of Friday the 13th the Game was slated for “Early 2017,” a time frame that managed both to be wide and for some fans, vague. This ambiguity caused quite a bit of energy to be directed at Gun Media, and in particular, at the Community Manager Ben Strauss. “It’s actually become a meme within our community,” said Strauss. “Someone sent me a mug that said, ‘Early 2017’ on it in Friday the 13th font.”"

Steve Daskawisz did Jason’s stunts for the majority of the movie. Jerry Wallace (who is credited as The Prowler) is said to have played the role in certain scenes. FX artist Carl Fullerton may have also appeared as Jason in the film as evidenced by a behind-the-scenes photo. However, the very first appearance of Jason was played by Costume Designer Ellen Lutter in a shot of Jason's feet walking toward Alice’s apartment"

They served as an homage to seminal special effects artist Tom Savini, as well as adding a darker layer to Tommy’s character, providing an omen of things to come. According to screenwriter Barney Cohen, they also made a philosophical point about horror: that it is contagious. The horror that Jason dispenses can be passed on to anyone."

"“I always said, any of the films I did as Jason, I would always warn the actors and they always thought it was kind of a joke but I was very serious saying, when it comes time for your death, it's not going to be easy it's not going to be comfortable, it's going to be a little rough I'm not going to hurt you, but it's going to be a little rougher than you expect. And sometimes they were quite tentative about it but then when they saw the final product 'oh I'm so glad you did it like that because it looks so much better.” – Kane Hodder, Friday the 13th: The Game, Kickstarter Video, October 13th, 2015"

Unfortunately, the plan fails, and Jason is inadvertently brought back to life.

Part 3 was released in glorious 3D and is the first movie to feature Jason wearing the iconic hockey mask. After Jason murders nearly everyone in sight, heroine Chris Higgins knocks him unconscious with a shovel, hangs him and finally takes a hatchet to his head to “take him out”. After August 13th, 1982, a hockey mask would never look the same again."

"Billed to be the end of the series, The Final Chapter delivers a thrilling resolution, if not an ending. Part IV is perhaps most notable for two things, the first one being Crispin Glover. His dance to woo one of the twins is one of the most idiosyncratic and perplexing dances in all of cinema. Of a more important note, the Final Chapter introduced to canon the mask-obsessed Tommy Jarvis played by the burgeoning star Corey Feldman. By ingenuity or madness, Tommy dresses up as a young boy-Jason in the final confrontation and delivers the mortal machete blows that would send Jason to his temporary grave."

"From map size to items, from stats to abilities, Friday the 13th: The Game has gone through countless revisions. One large addition was the “composure stat”. At the beginning Jason had the ability to “Blood Ping,” essentially allowing him to locate any counselor no matter what. “At any given moment he could take you by surprise,” said dev Ronnie Hobbs. “Turned out that wasn’t fun.” So instead the devs instituted a fear system. Randy Greenback, Executive Director of Gun Media, described it this way. “Jason only has to get close to a counselor to instill fear in them. He’s like a game of horseshoes.”"

"From the CJ-7s in the original movie to Megan’s hot rod in Part VI, there have been many memorable automobiles in the films. In Part V, Ethel's wild son Jr., crazily rides a motorcycle before being decapitated with a meat cleaver. Without much of a budget the director had the actor playing Jr., Ron Sloan, do the stunt himself. It required Sloan to ride a motorcycle recklessly through the forest with a $50,000 camera mounted to the handlebars."

"From the shores of Crystal Lake to the sewers of Manhattan, the protagonists of Friday the 13th Part VIII go the distance. In a desperate escape from the teleporting Jason, Sean and Rennie find themselves on a sewer ladder. Jason reaches up to grab Rennie before being inundated with a rush of toxic waste. As the flood races towards him he speaks in the spectral voice of Jason as a boy: “Mommy! Don’t let me drown. Mommy?” As the turbid sewer waters recede, we see not the rotted hulk of Jason but the corpse of a young drowned boy."

According to dev Ronnie Hobbs, one item that required adjustment was the Firecrackers. “If you played the Beta you’d know that firecrackers used to be the least useful item in the game. They were designed to be a deterrent to fool Jason. You could throw something down and if he was using sense he would see sound pings and you could run the other way. Firecrackers can stun him now.”"

"In Friday lore, Steve Christy is the entrepreneurial son of David and Louise Christy who owned Camp Crystal Lake at the time of Jason's drowning. Steve takes it upon himself to renovate the camp and reopen it. By fixing the camp he draws the murderous ire of the killer, still reeling from Jason’s death. Who knows, if it hadn’t been for Steve perhaps Camp Blood would have remained dormant and the world would have been robbed of one of its great fictional villains."

The headpiece was chosen because it was an item that would have been readily available to the killer.

In retaliation, the gang follows the two back to Crystal Lake with the intention of getting revenge. The bikers Ali, Fox, and Loco, siphon gas from a car in order to burn down the barn but are ultimately foiled when they encounter Jason. It is not revealed how Loco got his nickname.

Illfonic and Gun Media corrected this for the Part IX Jason in the game. The devs took a poll to see if the mistake should be retconned or let be. The verdict was that it should be fixed. Many at Gun including Ronnie Hobbs were still conflicted. “There were some people that wanted it not to be fixed. But [if we didn’t] we couldn’t live with ourselves."

"In a roundtable about the Friday the 13th series, special effects master Tom Savini described his initial idea for Jason’s death in Part IV. “I thought that young Tommy, who was an effects kid, an inventor, would take a microwave oven apart and put a reflector on the shooter, with a variable setting of 1-10. On ‘one’ it would melt the toy soldier. My idea was to stick that in Jason’s head and cook his head from within and make it explode. So, I had to sell that to the money guys. I called him and what he said was ‘no, no, no, the Friday the 13th formula is killing naked teenagers in the woods with household implements,’ I’m thinking this is a household implement!”"

Cunningham, they’d been talking about making a Friday game for twenty years but didn’t latch onto an idea until they got wind of Gun’s project. “Wes and the guys had been working on this idea for Summer Camp which, in a lot of ways had so much in it that we hoped would be included in a Friday the 13th game. It involved active participation and it took the experience to what we hoped was going to be this new, big, ballsy level.”"

"In the 10th film of the series, Jason is sent into the far future and into outer-space. With a cameo death by David Cronenberg, a holographic double sleeping bag kill, and the infamous liquid nitrogen face smash, Jason X has some great highlights. Perhaps most memorable is the introduction of Uber Jason. In a brutal battle with the android KM-14, Jason falls defeated into a nano-medbay that rebuilds the killer into a powerful cyborg with red eyes. Reborn, Uber Jason finds he has monstrous strength and is impervious to bullets and roundhouses from androids. Uber Jason is as indestructible as a falling star."

This distraction gives Chris enough time to take an axe and strike Jason in the head. Exhausted from the battle, Chris staggers into a canoe and drifts into Crystal lake. In a nightmare Pamela Voorhees emerges from the lake to pull her in. The following morning the police arrive and usher Chris away. Jason’s body is shown, still lying in the barn, a threat no longer."

Part VII features several intense battle scenes, creatively brutal kills (like the sleeping bag), and memorable characters, but more importantly, this film makes the first time Kane Hodder would step into the role of Jason Voorhees. Kane's intimidating portrayal of Jason quickly propelled him into a fan favorite, and ultimately allowed Kane to don the hockey mask for the next three films."

Most of the underwater scenes were shot in a temperature controlled tank in Los Angeles. The above water scenes were shot on location in Georgia. The last bit where Jason’s neck meets the boat propeller were filmed in the pool of the director’s father. Reportedly the amount of chum spread by the blade ruined the pool’s filtration system. However, this did little to perturb the patriarch who could boast that a Hollywood picture was filmed in his backyard."

"No doubt the most divisive entry in the franchise, Jason Goes to Hell's decision to focus on the <q>possession<q> angle meant virtually no screen time for Jason himself. Still, the film had an array of brutal kills, a cool Jason design, and a demonic soundtrack created by Harry Manfredini. The other horror icon’s cameo at the end was controversial, but it helped set the stage for a future movie showdown, and the Tom Savini designed Jason created exclusively for this game."

"Nudity is one of the hallmarks of a Friday film, principally female nudity. In the 9th installment, The Final Friday, Adam Marcus subverted the expectation by including male nudity in roughly equal measure. Including a scene which has been described by many as the “homoerotic shaving scene.”"

While only a tiny portion was actually filmed in Manhattan, that didn't stop Paramount from heavily promoting the NY angle. Jason even made a surprise visit on The Arsenio Hall Show. We also saw future star Kelly Hu make her film debut. "

"One lesson developers of Friday the 13th: The Game learned, is that sometimes the absence of a trait  can be more interesting. In a PAX Panel, F13 Game consultant Adam Sessler unpacked it this way: “If you think about a slasher film, you don’t have seven smart, talented, athletic counselors that are up against Jason. They all maybe have a benefit here and there, but on the whole they kinda suck. And that’s the part of the fun of the movie. One thing I’ve learned in the course of playing this game is when things go wrong...it’s actually more fun.”"

There were hundreds of people on both sides of the street watching the filming. With one quick look from Jason the crowd would scream, cheer, and go wild."

"One of the most popular kills in the series can be found in Friday the 13th Part 2. It involves the loveable wheelchair-bound jock, Mark. Confined to the wheelchair by a motorcycle accident, Mark remains optimistic that he might walk again. Mark took a machete to the face, causing him to roll backwards down a long flight of stairs. It is a classic kill in the series, made even more notable in that it is the first time Jason kills someone with his signature machete."

"Part 2, is the first film to feature Jason Voorhees as the killer. After surviving drowning and living alone in the woods for more than 20 years, “Sackhead” Jason emerges to exact revenge for the murder of his mother, Pamela Voorhees. Continuing his mother’s mission to keep Crystal Lake closed, he decimates nearly every Counselor at the Packanack Lodge training center. Only the aspiring child psychologist, Ginny Field, is able to outsmart and eventually “defeat” Jason. She puts on Pamela’s sweater to trigger Jason, and then buries a machete deep into his shoulder. After the credits roll, one question remains… “Where the hell is Paul?” "

"Part VII is perhaps the most censored Friday movie of all time. One particular kill that the MPAA sent back for several revisions was the infamous sleeping bag kill. In the movie Jason, played by Kane Hodder, had to pick up a sleeping bag stuffed with a heavy dummy and 20 additional gallons of blood and slam it against a tree. Hodder struggled to make the stunt believable and was relieved when the ratings board limited the scene to one good tree smack."

"Sean S. Cunningham, the creator of Friday the 13th is known as the father of Jason. During the development of Friday the 13th: The Game, he outlined for the devs his take on the role of the protagonist and why Friday movies are fun. “What happened with Friday the 13th is almost anti-dramatic...You’re supposed to have a hero that you empathize with and care for and then you put that person in jeopardy. You’re with them, and hope they make it and usually they do, and then you have a happy ending.  I’ve seen so many Friday the 13th scripts that were designed to find [what the protagonist] really cares about what, and what their dreams are--therefore we’re really going to care about her when she goes wandering in the woods. I discovered that in Friday the 13th movies--and horror movies in general--it’s not that you create people that you care so much about, but you create people that you’d like to see wacked.”"

The original home video release was in 2D on VHS, Betamax, Capacitance Electronic Disc, and LaserDisc. Only later was a Deluxe Blu-ray edition sold that had the 3D version along with a pair of red/blue 3D glasses fashioned to look like Jason’s mask."

"The murderous history of Camp Crystal Lake, and the locals’ warnings do not deter new counselors from setting up a summer camp. One by one, the counselors are stalked and slaughtered by a merciless and mysterious killer -- Pamela Voorhees. She is on a rampage to avenge the death of her son Jason, who drowned in the lake because irresponsible and promiscuous counselors were not supervising him. The film ends with one of the most memorable stingers in cinema history."

"The “Grendel” is the name of the ship that Jason is taken aboard before re-awakening. It is also the name of the monster in the Old-English poem Beowulf. In that poem Grendel, aggravated by the sounds of revelry, attacks the great hall, killing many men before being mortally wounded by the hero. Grendel’s mother, angry at her son’s death seeks revenge. Ultimately, Beowulf tracks the vengeful matron to her warren at the bottom of a lake, slicing off her head and the head of Grendel’s corpse resting in its watery grave …hmm sounds familiar. "

"There were quite a few ideas that the game developers tested and ultimately scrapped. In a panel about the game, dev Ronnie Hobbs described their initial thought on the car. “Early on in development we had this idea where Jason could do something to the car. The problem is that’s the first thing he does. If you know that you can break the car, Jason goes there immediately and breaks it. And then there are the physics involved. If you’ve played our Beta you saw how funny the car physics were. The cars would end up on top of houses, in trees, they would go flying into outer space.”"

Graham would dress as Jason and scare them in the middle of the hypnosis. The production team was impressed and cast Graham as Jason for the movie."

Perhaps it was in an actual cemetery that McLoughlin dreamt up the famous scene where Jason is electrocuted back to life. On a dark and stormy night Tommy Jarvis, in a tragic hunt for absolution, digs up Jason’s grave. Upon seeing his worm infested carcass Jarvis snaps. Taking a metal pole from the cemetery fence he stabs at Jason’s lifeless body. Unfortunately for him, it was during a thunderstorm.

"Tom Savini, whose guidance helped shaped the kills in two Friday movies as well as Friday the 13th: The Game always anchored his special effects in the real world. “It can’t be preposterous,” said Savini in an interview, “because you won’t believe it.” And while the realness of practical effects come at a cost to time, resources, and ingenuity, for Savini, it was always worth it. “Did I scare you? That’s what I do.”"

They served as an homage to seminal special effects artist Tom Savini, as well as adding a darker layer to Tommy’s character, providing an omen of things to come. According to screenwriter Barney Cohen, they also made a philosophical point about horror: that it is contagious. The horror that Jason dispenses can be passed on to anyone."

"Which version of Jason should be canon? According to Wes Keltner “Hardcore fans know they used two actors, that they had a fat Jason at the beginning that got fired, and then hired another guy to come in. Even the masks changed. During the shoot, the actor is always taking the mask off and on in between shots, their hands are dirty, they usually pick up by the nose to put it on. So, as the film progresses [the bridge of the nose] gets darker and darker as they film. So, if we're tasked with making the mask from Part VI, well, how dirty and dingy is the mask? Are we talking reel six or reel two? We're not phoning it in.”"
